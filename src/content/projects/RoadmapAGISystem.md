Building an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system with neural networks and transformer architecture is a challenging task and possibly impossible task for an individual. However, with the right approach and data, it's possible to develop a system that can perform a small range of intellectual tasks. We can argue if the system doesn't perform sufficiently human-level intellectual task or beyond can it be considered AGI? The intention of this blog post is not to delve into those questions, but to give overview of implementing the artifically intelligent system that could potentially perform human-level or beyond intellectual task.

Here's a roadmap that can help you get started:

1. Learn the basics of neural networks: Neural networks are a set of algorithms that are designed to mimic the human brain's functioning. You can start by learning the basics of neural networks, such as activation functions, backpropagation, and gradient descent.
2. Understand the transformer architecture: The transformer architecture is a type of neural network that is designed to process sequential data, such as language or audio. It's composed of multiple layers of attention mechanisms that can learn complex patterns in data.
3. Collect and preprocess data: To train an AGI system, you need to collect vast amounts of data and preprocess it to make it suitable for neural networks. You can use public datasets, such as the Common Crawl dataset, or collect your data through web scraping or other methods.
4. Build a transformer-based AGI model: To build an AGI system using the transformer architecture, you can use frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Start by building a transformer model that can process sequential data and use transfer learning to adapt it to new tasks.
5. Train the model: Once you have built the model, you need to train it on the collected data. Use techniques such as batch normalization, dropout, and regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance.
6. Test and evaluate the model: After training the model, you need to test it on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance. Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to measure the model's performance.
7. Continue learning: AGI is an ever-evolving field, and there is always something new to learn. Stay up-to-date with the latest research, attend conferences and workshops, and engage with the community to keep yourself updated.

Thus, building an AGI system with neural networks and transformer architecture is a challenging but exciting task. By following this roadmap and continuously learning and improving, you can develop an AGI system that can perform a small range of intellectual tasks. Remember to start with the basics, collect and preprocess data, build a transformer-based AGI model, train and test it, and continue learning.

**Upcoming and ongoing project. Will upload the code soon.**
