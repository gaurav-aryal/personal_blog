## System Architecture

A comprehensive MLOps pipeline that combines automated training, deployment, monitoring, and model lifecycle management.

### Core Components

1. Model Training Pipeline
2. Deployment System
3. Monitoring Framework
4. Lifecycle Management

### Key Features

- **Continuous Training**
  - Automated model retraining
  - Data validation and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering pipeline

- **Model Deployment**
  - Containerized model serving
  - A/B testing support
  - Rollback capabilities

- **Monitoring**
  - Real-time performance tracking
  - Data drift detection
  - Model health metrics

- **Lifecycle Management**
  - Version control for models
  - Automated model updates
  - Audit trail and logging

### Implementation Details

The system uses:
- PyTorch/TensorFlow for model development
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
