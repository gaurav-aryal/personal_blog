In his fascinating book "Numbers Don't Lie: 71 Things You Need to Know About the World", author Vaclav Smil takes the reader on a globe-spanning tour of the most mind-blowing stats and data that shape our modern world. Filled with surprising facts on everything from energy and agriculture to demographics and urbanization, this book will radically shift your perspective. Here are some of the most eye-opening numbers I learned:

**Population**  
- There are currently 7.7 billion people on Earth, with projections of 9-10 billion by 2050 if fertility rates continue declining
- 54% of the world's population lives in urban areas as of 2020, up from just 30% in 1950 
- Nigeria is adding almost 1 million new city dwellers every single year, more than any other country

**Food and Agriculture**  
- Just 15 crop plants provide 90% of the world's food energy intake, with rice, wheat, and corn accounting for two-thirds of this
- Worldwide, farmers apply around 200 million tons of synthetic fertilizers every year
- The US uses 326 billion liters of water every day for irrigated agriculture, enough to drain a typical Great Lake in 90 years

**Energy and the Environment**  
- Global energy consumption is still rising at around 2% per year, driven heavily by growth in Asia
- Burning fossil fuels puts over 35 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere annually 
- The cement industry generates around 8% of global CO2 emissions, more than global aviation

**Transportation**  
- There are over 1 billion motor vehicles on the world's roads, with the US having 1 vehicle for every 1.2 adults
- Air passengers traveled over 8 trillion kilometers in 2018, the equivalent of over 100,000 trips to the Sun
- Container ships transport over 60% of global imports/exports by value, with the largest vessels capable of carrying 24,000 containers

These are just a small sample of the fascinating data points contained in "Numbers Don't Lie." Smil has a true gift for curating and contextualizing the key numerical facts that give unparalleled insights into the state of our civilization and our species' footprint on this planet. Whether you're simply a stats buff or someone looking to deepen your understanding of pivotal global issues, this book is an absolute must-read.
