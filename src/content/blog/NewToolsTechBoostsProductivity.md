As a software developer, it can be easy to get attached to the familiar tools and programming languages that we've grown accustomed to. However, in today's rapidly changing technological landscape, it's more important than ever to embrace new tools and technologies that can help us be more productive and create more value. It also follows the natural progression of evolution of machine instructions from bits -> assembly -> higher level programming languages -> Human Language.

One of the most exciting developments in recent years has been the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning. With tools like OpenAI's API powered GitHub's Copilot, developers can now use AI-powered code assistants to help them write code faster and more accurately than ever before.

While some may be hesitant to rely on AI for programming, the reality is that these tools can greatly enhance our productivity and efficiency as developers. Copilot, for example, can suggest code snippets and complete entire lines of code based on the context and syntax of the code we're working on.

This not only saves time and reduces the risk of errors, but it also frees up our mental bandwidth to focus on more complex and creative aspects of programming, such as designing and implementing new features and functionality.

Of course, AI-powered code assistants like Copilot are just one example of the many tools and technologies that can help us be more productive as developers. From cloud computing and DevOps tools to new programming languages and frameworks, there's a wealth of resources available to help us work smarter.
