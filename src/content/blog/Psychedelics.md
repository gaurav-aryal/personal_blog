Psychedelics are a class of psychoactive substances that have been used by cultures throughout history for medicinal, spiritual, and recreational purposes. They include substances such as LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and DMT. Over the past few years, there has been a resurgence of interest in these substances as a tool for personal growth and exploration. In this blog post, I will share my personal experience of how psychedelics changed my view of the world.

Growing up, I was always a very logical and analytical person. I believed in science and reason, and I was skeptical of anything that couldn't be explained by empirical evidence. However, as I got older, I started to feel like something was missing. I had a deep sense that there was more to life than what I could see and understand.

I first heard about psychedelics from a friend who had tried them and said they had a profound impact on his life. I was curious but also hesitant. I had always been taught that drugs were bad, and I was afraid of the unknown. Eventually, my curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to try LSD.

The experience was like nothing I had ever felt before. It was as if a veil had been lifted, and I was able to see the world in a new way. I felt connected to everything around me, and I had a deep sense of empathy and compassion for all living beings. I saw the beauty in everything, even in things that I had previously considered ugly or unimportant.
