## Introduction

Modern enterprise systems demand architectures that are both resilient and scalable. As organizations like Amazon, Meta, and PayPal have shown, the ability to handle failures gracefully and scale horizontally is not just a luxury—it's a necessity. This post synthesizes lessons from *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* with hands-on experience building Medicaid and SNAP backend pipelines, ECS deployments, and observability-first services.

## Why Resilience and Scalability Matter

In regulated domains like healthcare, backend services must process millions of transactions reliably. Outages or data loss can have real-world consequences. For example, Medicaid eligibility and claims processing pipelines must be robust against spikes, partial failures, and integration hiccups.

## Architecture Principles

### Domain-Driven Decomposition
- **Bounded Contexts:** Split the system into well-defined domains (e.g., eligibility, claims, notifications).
- **Service Modularity:** Each service owns its data and logic, reducing coupling and enabling independent deployments.

### Event-Driven vs. REST
- **REST:** Synchronous, simple for CRUD, but can create tight coupling and cascading failures.
- **Event-Driven:** Asynchronous, decouples producers/consumers, enables audit trails and retries. Used for Medicaid eligibility events, claim status updates, and cross-system notifications.

### Fault Isolation and Service Independence
- **Bulkheads:** Limit blast radius of failures (e.g., separate ECS tasks for critical vs. non-critical services).
- **Graceful Degradation:** Non-essential features can fail without impacting core flows.

## Patterns for Resilience

### Circuit Breakers
- Prevent repeated calls to failing dependencies (e.g., external payment APIs).
- Implemented with libraries like Resilience4j or Hystrix.

### Retries with Backoff
- Use exponential backoff and jitter to avoid thundering herd problems.
- Example: Retrying failed S3 uploads or EDI file transfers in Medicaid pipelines.

### Transaction Management with Spring
- Use `@Transactional` for atomicity within a service boundary.
- For distributed transactions, prefer Sagas or outbox patterns over 2PC.

## Scaling Techniques

### Database Partitioning
- **Sharding:** Split large tables by tenant or region.
- **Read Replicas:** Offload reporting/analytics queries from primaries.

### Stateless Services
- Store session state in Redis or DynamoDB, not in-memory.
- Enables horizontal scaling on ECS/EC2.

### AWS RDS + EC2 Horizontal Scaling
- Use RDS Multi-AZ for failover.
- ECS with auto-scaling groups to handle load spikes.

## DevOps + Observability

### CI/CD Pipelines with Docker + ECS
- Automated builds, tests, and blue/green deployments.
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation) for repeatability.

### Distributed Tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Trace requests across services (e.g., eligibility → claims → notifications).
- Pinpoint bottlenecks and failure points in real time.

### New Relic and Metrics-Driven Debugging
- Custom dashboards for latency, error rates, and throughput.
- Alerting on SLO/SLA violations.

## Main Topics

- **Fault Tolerance:** Circuit breakers, retries, and bulkheads.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Statelessness, auto-scaling, and partitioning.
- **Observability:** Distributed tracing, metrics, and alerting.
- **Tradeoffs:** CAP theorem, consistency vs. availability, and scaling bottlenecks.
- **Real-World Examples:** Medicaid/SNAP pipelines, ECS deployments, OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

Building resilient and scalable microservices is a journey, not a destination. Next steps include:
- **Caching:** Add Redis or CDN layers for read-heavy flows.
- **Kafka:** Adopt event streaming for high-throughput, decoupled processing.
- **Global Failover:** Multi-region deployments for disaster recovery.

This approach not only powers mission-critical systems today but also lays the foundation for a robust, observable, and scalable tech stack—ready for the next wave of enterprise challenges.
