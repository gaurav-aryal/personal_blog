Concurrency and multi-threading are related concepts, but they are not the same thing. Concurrency refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously, while multi-threading is a specific way of implementing concurrency using threads.

Concurrency can be achieved using various techniques such as multi-processing, multi-tasking, and multi-threading. Multi-threading is a technique that allows a single process to have multiple threads of execution, each of which can run concurrently.

One key difference between concurrency and multi-threading is that concurrency can be achieved without using threads, whereas multi-threading is specifically a technique that involves using threads. Concurrency can be achieved through techniques such as event-driven programming, non-blocking I/O, and cooperative multitasking.

Another difference between the two is that multi-threading is generally considered to be more efficient than other forms of concurrency, particularly in cases where there are many short-lived tasks. This is because creating and managing threads is relatively lightweight, and there is minimal overhead involved in context switching between threads.

However, multi-threading also has its downsides. One of the main challenges of multi-threading is ensuring that threads do not interfere with each other, which can lead to synchronization and deadlock issues. In addition, multi-threaded programs can be difficult to debug and can suffer from performance issues if not implemented correctly.

An example of implementing **multi-threading** in Python:  
```python
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(f"Number: {i}")
        
def print_letters():
    for letter in ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']:
        print(f"Letter: {letter}")

thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Done!")
```
In this example, we import the threading module and define two functions that will be run concurrently: *print_numbers* and *print_letters*. We then create two threads, *thread1* and *thread2*, and assign each function to be run by its respective thread.  
Next, we start the threads with *thread1.start()* and *thread2.start()*. The *join()* method is used to make sure that both threads finish before moving on to the *print("Done!")* statement.  
When we run this code, we will see that the numbers and letters are printed in an interleaved manner, demonstrating the concept of multi-threading.  

An example of **concurrency** in Python using the asyncio library:
```python
import asyncio

async def task_one():
    print("Starting task one")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Finished task one")

async def task_two():
    print("Starting task two")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Finished task two")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task_one(), task_two())

asyncio.run(main())
```
In this example, we define two tasks *(task_one and task_two)* that each take a certain amount of time to complete. We then define a main function that uses *asyncio.gather* to run both tasks concurrently.  
When we run the program, we'll see that the tasks start and finish at different times, but they're both executed "at the same time" thanks to the concurrent execution provided by *asyncio*.
