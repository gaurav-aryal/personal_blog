The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable is a book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb that explores the concept of rare and unpredictable events, or "black swans," and their impact on our lives. In this book, Taleb argues that most of the events in our lives are probabilities, and that we often ignore the possibility of black swans and are subsequently surprised by their occurrence.

Taleb defines a black swan as an event that is rare, has a major impact, and is difficult or impossible to predict. Examples of black swan events include the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the global financial crisis of 2008, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These events are difficult to predict because they are rare and often involve complex systems that are difficult to fully understand.

Despite the unpredictable nature of black swans, Taleb argues that we can still prepare for them by adopting what he calls an "antifragile" mindset. This means that instead of trying to predict and control everything in our lives, we should focus on building resilience and adaptability. By embracing uncertainty and preparing for the unexpected, we can better weather the impact of black swans when they occur.

One reason why we tend to ignore the possibility of black swans is because we are wired to think in terms of averages and normal distributions. We tend to assume that most events will fall within a predictable range, and we are often blindsided when a rare event occurs. This is known as the "normalcy bias," and it can lead us to underestimate the likelihood and impact of black swans.

Another reason why we ignore black swans is because we tend to focus on short-term outcomes and ignore long-term risks. We often prioritize immediate gains over long-term stability, and this can lead us to overlook the potential for black swans to disrupt our plans.
