The world is full of problems that need solutions. Poverty, disease, inequality, climate change, and many other issues plague our societies. It's easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless in the face of such challenges. However, I believe that building products and services is the best way to make an impact in the world.

Why do I believe this? Because products and services have the power to scale. When you build a product or service, you can potentially reach millions or even billions of people. You can solve problems on a massive scale. Think about the impact that smartphones have had on the world. They've transformed the way we communicate, access information, and conduct business. This has had a profound effect on billions of people around the world.

Furthermore, products and services have the potential to create positive feedback loops. When you build something that people find valuable, they will use it more. This can lead to network effects, where the value of the product or service increases as more people use it. For example, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are more valuable to users the more people are on the platform. This creates a virtuous cycle of growth and impact.

Building products and services also has the potential to create new markets and opportunities. When you solve a problem in a novel way, you can create demand for a new product or service. This can lead to job creation, economic growth, and social change. For example, the rise of electric vehicles has created new markets for batteries, charging stations, and other related products and services. This has the potential to transform the automotive industry and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.

Of course, building products and services is not a panacea. It's not a silver bullet that can solve all of the world's problems. There are many challenges that cannot be addressed through technology or entrepreneurship alone. However, I believe that building products and services is one of the most effective ways to make a positive impact in the world. It allows us to scale our efforts, create positive feedback loops, and create new markets and opportunities.

So, if you want to make an impact in the world, consider building a product or service. Identify a problem that you're passionate about solving, and use your skills and expertise to create a solution. You may not solve the problem on your own, but you can make a meaningful contribution to a larger effort.
