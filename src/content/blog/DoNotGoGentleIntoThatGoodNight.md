Do not go gentle into that good night,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light,  
Let not death's quiet and gentle shroud,  
Tear from you your voice so proud.  

Do not let your soul slip away,  
Unnoticed in the light of day,  
Fight the forces that pull you down,  
And rise above the gloom with a thunderous sound.  

Rage, rage against the dying of the light,  
Never give up without a fight,  
The flames of passion burn within,  
And will carry you through the tempest's din.  

The end may come, but let it not define,  
The life you led, your spirit's sign,  
Let your legacy burn bright and true,  
And let your soul be born anew.  

So do not go gentle into that good night,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light,  
Let your fury be the spark that ignites,  
And let your soul blaze into the night.
