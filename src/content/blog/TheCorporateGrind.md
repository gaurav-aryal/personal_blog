Many of us spend the majority of our waking hours slaving away at a corporate job. We wake up early, commute to work, spend the day in a cubicle or office, and then commute back home, exhausted and drained. It's easy to feel like life is passing us by while we toil away in a corporate environment. In this blog post, we'll explore why this happens and what we can do about it.

The first reason why life can seem to pass us by when we're working a corporate job is that these jobs often lack meaning and purpose. We may feel like we're just going through the motions, doing the same tasks day after day, without any real sense of accomplishment or impact. When we lack a sense of purpose, it can be hard to feel motivated and engaged, and time can seem to drag on endlessly.

Another reason why corporate jobs can make life feel like it's passing us by is that they can be incredibly time-consuming. Many of us work long hours, and when we're not working, we may be thinking about work, checking our email, or answering phone calls. This leaves little time for personal pursuits, hobbies, or relationships outside of work. When we feel like we're always working and never truly living, it's easy to feel like life is slipping away from us.

The structure of corporate jobs can also contribute to this feeling of time passing us by. Many jobs involve sitting in front of a computer for hours on end, which can be incredibly draining and isolating. We may feel disconnected from the world around us and from our own bodies, which can make time feel like it's moving more slowly.

So, what can we do about it? The first step is to recognize that we have a choice in how we spend our time. We may feel like we're trapped in a corporate job, but there are always alternatives. We can seek out more meaningful work, even if it pays less, or we can try to find ways to make our current job more engaging and impactful.

Another option is to create more balance in our lives outside of work. We can prioritize personal relationships, hobbies, and self-care, and make sure we're not letting work consume all of our time and energy.

We can try to reframe our perspective on time. Instead of feeling like life is passing us by, we can try to focus on being present in each moment and savoring the experiences we have, both inside and outside of work. We can remind ourselves that time is a precious resource, and that we have the power to use it in a way that feels meaningful and fulfilling to us.
