Butler Lampson is a renowned computer scientist, mathematician, and physicist who is known for his contributions to the development of personal computing, computer networking, and distributed systems. Born on December 23, 1943, in Washington, D.C., Lampson's academic career has been marked by numerous accolades and achievements, including a Turing Award, the highest honor in computer science.

Lampson received his bachelor's degree in physics from Harvard University in 1964 and then went on to study at the University of California, Berkeley, where he obtained a Ph.D. in computer science in 1967. After completing his doctoral studies, Lampson joined the newly-formed Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1970, where he worked alongside other computer science pioneers, such as Alan Kay, Chuck Thacker, and Bob Taylor.

At Xerox PARC, Lampson was involved in a number of groundbreaking research projects, including the development of the Alto, one of the first personal computers. The Alto was a pioneering system that introduced many of the features that are now commonplace in modern computers, such as the graphical user interface (GUI), the mouse, and Ethernet networking.

In addition to his work on the Alto, Lampson was also involved in the development of other important technologies, such as the laser printer, the Ethernet network protocol, and the Bravo text editor. His contributions to these projects helped to lay the foundation for the modern computing industry, and his work at Xerox PARC is widely regarded as a key factor in the rise of Silicon Valley as a center for technological innovation.

Following his time at Xerox PARC, Lampson joined Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1984, where he continued to work on computer networking and distributed systems. At DEC, Lampson was a key member of the team that developed the Network File System (NFS), a protocol that allows users to access files over a network as if they were stored locally.

In addition to his work in industry, Lampson has also been a prolific researcher and academic. He has published numerous papers on a wide range of topics, including computer security, distributed systems, programming languages, and operating systems. Lampson has also been a professor at several universities, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he has been a professor of electrical engineering and computer science since 1994.

Throughout his career, Lampson has been recognized for his contributions to computer science and technology. He was awarded the Turing Award in 1992 for his pioneering work on personal computing and distributed systems. In addition, Lampson has been the recipient of numerous other awards and honors, including the National Academy of Engineering's Charles Stark Draper Prize, the Association for Computing Machinery's Software System Award, and the IEEE John von Neumann Medal.

Butler Lampson is one of the most influential and important computer scientists of the 20th century. His work on personal computing, computer networking, and distributed systems helped to shape the modern computing industry and laid the foundation for many of the technologies that we use today. Lampson's contributions to the field of computer science have been widely recognized, and his legacy continues to inspire and influence new generations of researchers and technologists.
